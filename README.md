Telegram Mini App that allows you to generate one-time 2FA passwords inside Telegram.

[➡️ **OPEN**]([TeleOTP](http://t.me/TeleOTPAppBot))

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Universal:** TeleOTP implements [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) (Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) which is used by most services.
* 👌 **Convenient:** Accounts are safely stored in your Telegram cloud storage, 
so you can access them anywhere you can use Telegram. 
* 🔒 **Secure:** All accounts are encrypted using AES. 
That means even if your Telegram account is breached, 
the attacker won't have access to your tokens without the encryption password. 
* 🥰 **User-friendly:** TeleOTP is designed to look like Telegram and follows your color theme.
* 🤗 **Open:** TeleOTP supports account migration to and from Google Authenticator. 
You can switch the platforms at any time without any hassle!

# ⚙️ Setup guide

## 📱 Mini App

TeleOTP is made with **React**, **Typescript**, and **[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)**. 
**Vite** frontend tooling is used for rapid development and easy deployment.

### Installing the dependencies

To begin working with the project, 
you should install the dependencies by running this command:

```shell
npm install
```

### Configuring the environment

Before starting the server or building the app, make sure that 
your project directory has a file named `.env`. 
It should follow the `.env.example` file structure.
You could also set these variables directly when running the app.

The app uses following environment variables:

* `VITE_BOT_USERNAME` - This value contains the bot username. 
It is used to send export requests to the bot. 
_Example: `VITE_BOT_USERNAME=TeleOTPAppBot`_
* `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` - The domain for Plausible analytics.
* `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_API_HOST` - API host to report Plausible analytics to.
* `VITE_CHANNEL_LINK` - Link to the news channel.
* `VITE_APP_NAME` - Name of the app for the URL.
  * For the app https://t.me/TeleOTPAppBot/app, app name is `app`
* `VITE_TRANSLATE_LINK` - Link to the translation website

### Starting the development server
To start the development server with hot reload, run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

After that, the server will be accessible on http://localhost:5173/

> [!NOTE]
> If you want the app to be accessible on your local network, you should add `--host` argument to the command

```shell
npm run dev -- --host
```

### Building the app

```shell
npm run build
```
After a successful build, app bundle will be available in `./dist`.

### 🔁 CI/CD
The app is built and deployed automatically using **Cloudflare Pages**.

## 💬 Bot

TeleOTP uses a helper bot to send user a link to the app and assist with account migration.
The bot is written in **Python** using [Python Telegram Bot library](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

### Starting bot

To start the bot, you have to run the `main.py` script with environment variables.
```shell
python main.py
```

### Environment variables

* `TOKEN` - Telegram bot token provided by @BotFather
* `TG_APP` - A link to the Mini App in Telegram (e.g. https://t.me/TeleOTPAppBot/app)
* `WEBAPP_URL` - Deployed Mini App URL (e.g. https://uselessstudio.github.io/TeleOTP)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that `WEBAPP_URL` doesn't end with a `/`! 
> It is added automatically by the bot.

### Running in Docker

We recommend running the bot inside the Docker container. 
The latest image is available at `ghcr.io/uselessstudio/teleotp-bot:main`.

Example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  bot:
    image: ghcr.io/uselessstudio/teleotp-bot:main
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TG_APP=https://t.me/TeleOTPAppBot/app
      - WEBAPP_URL=https://uselessstudio.github.io/TeleOTP
      - TOKEN=<insert your token>
```

And running is as simple as:
```shell
docker compose up
```

### 🔁 CI/CD
GitHub Actions is used to automate the building of the bot container.
The workflow is defined in the [`bot.yml` file](.github/workflows/bot.yml)
and ran on every push to `main`. After a successful build, 
the container is published in the GitHub Container Registry.  


# 💻 Structure

## 🛣️ Routing

TeleOTP uses React Router to switch between pages. 
Routes are specified in the `main.tsx` file.

* Route implemented in `Root.tsx` is responsible for showing "required" screens:
  * `PasswordSetup.tsx` is a screen which is showed when no password is created.
  Alternatively, this screen is shown when user clicked a button to change the password.
  It displays a prompt to create a new password which is used to encrypt the accounts.
  * `Decrypt.tsx` is a screen which shows a password prompt to decrypt stored accounts.
  By default, it is shown only once on a new device. 
  Later, the password retrieved from `localStorage` (if not disabled in the settings).
* `Accounts.tsx` is the main screen, which shows the generated password and a list of accounts that user has.
* `NewAccount.tsx` is a screen, which prompts user to open the QR-code scanner. 
Otherwise, user could press a button to enter an account manually, which would redirect them to `ManualAccount.tsx`
* `ManualAccount.tsx` prompts user to enter a secret for an OTP account.
* `CreateAccount.tsx` is a final step in the account creation flow. User is redirected here after scanning a QR-code 
or after manually providing a secret. 
This screen allows user to change issuer and label and to select an icon with a color for the account.
* `EditAccount.tsx` is a screen similar to `CreateAccount.tsx` which allows 
user to edit or delete an account. 
* `Settings.tsx` is a menu screen with a few options. User can delete all accounts, 
encrypt them, change the password, or set preferences.
* `ExportAccounts.tsx` is a page that handles the export logic. 
  * `QrExport.tsx` is a screen that provides a QR-code with account data.
  * `LinkExport.tsx` is a screen which allows to copy a link to import accounts.
* `ResetAccounts.tsx` is a page that verifies that the user wants to delete all accounts and reset the password. 
This page can be accessed through the settings, or by typing in the password incorrectly when decrypting.
* `DevToolsPage.tsx` is a debugging page, which allows checking the storage. (Only available in dev env)
* `IconBrowser.tsx` is a page for browsing icons from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/). 
User is able to search for icons.

## ✈️ Migration

TeleOTP implements the `otpauth-migration` URI standard. 
During the migration, accounts are (de)serialized using Protocol Buffers.

## 🤗 Icons and colors

All generic icons and colors for accounts are defined in the `globals.tsx` file.
Available icons are exported in the `icons` const, colors are available in the `colors` const.
`Icon` and `Color` types are provided for checking the validity of the corresponding item.

## 🌍 Translating

TeleOTP is officially translated only to Russian. If you have spare time and would like to help out the project,
please add translations at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/teleotp).

Currently supported languages:
* English (official)
* Russian (official)
* Ukrainian
* German
* French
* Spanish

If you need to add new strings:
1. Modify the file `src/lang/en.ts` to have a new string with a descriptive key.
    1. If a string needs to have variables, put them in braces `like {this}`
2. Use the `useL10n()` hook to get the translation.
